## Literature Organization

### Zotero

- Best feature: Zotero browser plug-in
- Saves article meta data and full-text PDF to your repository with (often) just one click

### Better BibTex

- Zotero plug-in
- generates LaTeX citekeys in the format `wickhamTidyData2014`
- keeps a `references.bib` file in your writing directory constantly up-to date
- Just type `[@wickhamTidyData2014]` in your script to include Wickham (2014) in your text

## RStudio Project

### Empirical Analysis

- Run all empirical analyses in an RStudio Project

### RMarkdown

- Build your tables and figures right from the data within your text. No need to save `.pdf` or `.png` files and then embed them
- Created customized LaTeX Template, based on [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), which is itself based on [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown)
- After that, you can write in easier and more readable Markdown Syntax
- Your template does all the translating from Markdown to LaTeX

## Git

- Version control everything: Scripts for data analysis AND Text
- Use a new line for at least every sentence!
- If you don't want to use the command line, use Git for Desktop instead of the RStudio Git extension (can become buggy when the project grows)

## Summary

Essential tools for my writing workflow:

- **Literature Organization:** Zotero & Zotero Browser plug-in and Better BibTex
- **Empirical Analysis:** RStudio project
- **Writing:** Write in RMarkdown and translate to nice LaTeX-PDF through a `.tex` template
- **Version Control:** Git for scripts *and* "text" files (use command line or Git for Desktop and not within RStudio)
