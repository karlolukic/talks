Git lets you and your collaborators

- keep track of all changes
- revert to previous stages of the project at any time without losing
  intermediate work
- share your projects in a reproducible way

# What's Git?

- Version control system
- Central repository for your project (i.e. advanced Dropbox for (text) files)
- Enables collaborative coding on projects 
- Enables you to keep track of all changes and be able to revert to previous points in time (without `script_v2_final_final.R`)

# My approach to Git
## When I use it
- For *all* projects I'm working on alone
- For most projects I'm working on collaboratively

## How I use it
- Within RStudio for R projects via the build-in Git interface (keeping track of `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.csv` files)
- Outside RStudio for all text-based files (i.e. LaTeX projects) via a Git GUI (e.g. GitKraken, Git for Desktop)
- no command line necessary
