# Why R Studio Cloud?

Often, the first steps in learning how to code in R are

- Install R
- Install RStudio IDE
- Install packages
- What the heck is this error?
- Why can't I generate PDFs from Markdown? What is LaTeX?
- "This is too difficult for me"

> **It's more encouraging to start coding with nice plots/applications in the fist minutes**

# R Studio Cloud Makes the First Steps a Breeze

## Features

- Use RStudio without any installation in the cloud!
- Students can dive right into programming without any installation problems
- Powerful assignment tools and pre-configured projects

## Use cases

- Data Science courses
  + create a workspace and invite students
  + create a base project: every new project has your prepared data scripts already loaded and your packages installed
  + let students share their projects
  + nice usage statistics (how much do the students actually code?)
  
- Your own sandbox: Check if your bug also happens on a fresh Linux system
- Easy-to use cloud instance for scripts that run up to 48h (only in the paid versions)
